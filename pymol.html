  <p id="protein-info">The protein model seen below was rendered using <strong>Schrodinger's</strong> open 
    source version of <strong>Pymol</strong>. The video captures a 360 degree overview of <strong>human hemoglobin</strong>.</p>
    <ul class="feature-list"> <p>Some key features:</p>
    <li> hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) </li>
    <li> oxygen molecules (red ball structures)</li>
    <li> tetramers (4 colored regions)</li>
    <li> chemical composition of the prosthetic heme group (orange/blue stick structure)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Purpose of Modeling</h2>
  <p id="protein-info">This model was created as a way for me to visualize biochemical concepts, particularly to 
  study the effects of <strong>diabetes on the body's bloodstream</strong>. One of
  the most common blood tests for diabetics is the <strong>A1C test</strong>, which 
  is a measure of how much <strong>glucose</strong> adheres to hemoglobin circulating in the bloodstream.
  An overabundance of glucose attachment to
  hemoglobin leads to a higher A1C, resulting in poor bodily control of <strong>blood sugar levels</strong> and 
  chronic underlying health conditions (stroke, heart attack, etc).</p>

<h2>Hemoglobin Background</h2>
  <p id="protein-info">Hemoglobin is a versatile protein in where oxygen is able to hydrogen bond to the beta sheets, earning
  it the nickname of an <strong>"O2 transporter"</strong>. It's quaternary structure 
  consists of <strong>4 tetramers (alpha and Beta)</strong> consisting of
  4 polypeptide chains. These include alpha and beta tetramer chains.
  The prosthetic/heme group is a non=-protein group that connect the ligands of the protein. The center
  of the heme group consists of iron, which allows the alpha tetramers to ineract with the beta tetramers.</p>

<h2>Glucose & Protein Interaction</h2>
  <p id="protein-info">The main issue with <strong>glucose interaction</strong> in the body stems from the presence of too many
  amino acids building up in the hemoglobin as it circulates through the blood. Primarily, excess <strong>leucine</strong>
  causes the liver to export too much glucose into the blood and thus elevating blood sugar levels. The body's
  response: <strong>increased insulin production</strong>. This increased production poses a significant health risk for
  <strong>Type 1 diabetic</strong> people who may need insulin injections to supplement bodily functions.</p>
