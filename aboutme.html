<p class="bio">An ambitious chemical engineering major pursuing a Bachelor's of Science aiming for a concentration in biopharmaceuticals. Minors in Chemistry and Mathematics.
    I have a vast experience with technical writing and research methods beginning in high school up to my current undergraduate level. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to expand my engineering skill set, both as an individual and in a team setting, and contribute to solutions that will maximize efficiency and benefit society.
    I am currently a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AiCHE).
    I am also the Managing Editor for Manhattan College's student newspaper, The Quadrangle.</p>
