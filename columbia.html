    <h1>Columbia University REU Experience</h1>

    <p class="description">I participated in the ChemE-NYC Climate Change and Health Solutions Cohort during the summer of 2023. I was able to work under
    the guidance of Dr. Aaron Moment in Moment and Kymissis Labs. Full presentation can be found here.</p>

                <h3>NIR Spectroscopy Experiments</h3>
                <p>I conducted NIR spectroscopy experiments on both an absorbent polymer sphere and a small porous sponge. The setup included a light-sensitive chamber with a light
                probe attached at the top. A 3D apparatus was needed to hold the polymer while it was drying.</p>
                <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
                <p>The goal was to monitor the change in wavelength of the material as it was air drying to determine if the rate
                would increase or decrease based on the amount of water in the sample. </p>

                    <h3>Transducer Drying Setup</h3>
                    <p>This setup included a chamber where the polymer sphere was dried while resting on top of an
                    ultrasonic transducer. The transducer emitted vibrational sound waves over the same length of time
                    as the NIR setup.</p>
                    <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
                    <p>The goal here was to determine if the drying rate of the polymer would increase when ultrasonic
                    sound waves were present over a specific length of time.</p>

                        <p>This setup was the driver circuit that allowed for the power output to the transducers. By
                        varying the frequency of the sound waves, the object between the transducers (paper) was able to
                        levitate between the nodes and anti-nodal positions.</p>
                        <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
                        <p>The goal was to determine the optimal frequency of vibration for the sound waves to dry the objects.</p>
