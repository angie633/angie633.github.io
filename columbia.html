<h1>Columbia University REU Experience</h1>
<p class="description">I participated in the ChemE-NYC Climate Change and Health Solutions Cohort during the summer of 2023. I was able to work under
the guidance of Dr. Aaron Moment in Moment and Kymissis Labs. Full presentation can be found here.</p>
<h2>Research Area: Ultrasonic Transducer Technology to Increase Drying Rate Efficiency</h2>

<div class="NIR">
    <h3>NIR Spectroscopy Experiments</h3>
    <p>I conducted NIR spectroscopy experiments on both an absorbent polymer sphere and a small porous sponge. The setup included a light-sensitive chamber with a light
    probe attached at the top. A 3D apparatus was needed to hold the polymer while it was drying.</p>
    <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
    <p>The goal was to monitor the change in wavelength of the material as it was air drying to determine if the rate
    would increase or decrease based on the amount of water in the sample. </p>
</div>

<div class="orbeez">
    <h3>Transducer Drying Setup</h3>
    <p>This setup included a chamber where the polymer sphere was dried while resting on top of an
    ultrasonic transducer. The transducer emitted vibrational sound waves over the same length of time
    as the NIR setup.</p>
    <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
    <p>The goal here was to determine if the drying rate of the polymer would increase when ultrasonic
    sound waves were present over a specific length of time.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="circuit">
    <h3>Driver Circuit & Levitation</h3>
    <p>This setup was the driver circuit that allowed for the power output to the transducers. By
    varying the frequency of the sound waves, the object between the transducers (paper) was able to
    levitate between the nodes and anti-nodal positions.</p>
    <h3>Purpose of Experiment</h3>
    <p>The goal was to determine the optimal frequency of vibration for the sound waves to dry the objects.</p>
</div>

<div class="printing">
    <h3>3D Printing Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a collection of the 3D printed models that had to be made for various parts of the
        experiments. Each one was designed using AutoCAD and had to be modified based on the
        requirements of the experiment.</p>
</div>

<div class="modeling">
    <h3>COMSOL Simulations</h3>
    <p>This is a collection of the COMSOL simulations that were made to model the drying process. Each
    one examines a different aspect of drying using ultrasonic waves versus without ultrasonic waves (in
    ambient conditions).</p>
