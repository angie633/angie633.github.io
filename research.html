<h1>Research Paper Archive</h1>
<p class="res_bio">This is a collection of research papers that I have written and compiled from the beginning of my undergrad career as part of my coursework for various classes. Each paper is listed with the topic it explores and the professor who helped guide me in creating it. </p>

    <h2>Impact of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing on India's Drinking Water--Guided by: Dr. James Patrick Abulencia</h2>
        <h3> Question Posed: To what extent does the pharmaceutical industry pollute India’s local water sources
surrounding chemical plants and what are the solutions?</h3>
        <strong><p>Background Info</p></strong>
        <p align="justify" style="padding:10px; overflow:scroll;">The pharmaceutical industry is globally connected and impacts every aspect of modern
life. The industry and its influence can be broken up into 4 distinct sectors, which includes
production, distribution, consumption, and waste. Production revolves around the physical and
chemical means to manufacture pharmaceutical products and ensure they’re the most effective.
Distribution can be expanded to include the scale up of chemical formulas and the physical
supplying of pharmaceuticals to hospitals and drugstores. The consumption sector focuses on the
interaction amongst the general population and the number of pharmaceuticals being handled and
ingested. Lastly, waste is the broad term for the excretion and removal of excess pharmaceuticals
from this cycle. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPQOMCLD-4Xw2p0V-qUYTcj_i6Q7NtQJ/view?usp=sharing">Read the full paper here </a> </p>

    <header><h1>Project 2</h1></header>
    <h2>Applications of Hydrogels formed from Spider Silk Proteins--Guided by: Dr. Connor Bilchak</h2>
    <strong><p>Background Info</p></strong>
    <p align="justify" style="padding:10px; overflow:scroll;">Hydrogel polymers that are synthesized from spider silk proteins are environmentally friendly
and possess a wide range of mechanical advantages. These mechanical advantages include high
levels of yield stress, high elastic and shear moduli, high tensile strengths, and other properties.
Likewise, spider silk found in nature possesses its individual mechanical advantages, such as
high tensile strengths, which contributes to the mechanical performance of the hydrogels. These
properties are associated with the cross-linked structure that forms from the synthesis of the silk
proteins. The mechanical properties can be optimized for biomedical applications such as
creating surgical meshes that can withstand high levels of stress from human bone or an
absorptive capsule that can capture large volumes of fluid. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/175fWQmo9jV3HNs1l_IG1a0CdITwCeB38/view?usp=sharing">Read the full paper here </a> </p>

     <header><h1>Project 3</h1></header>
    <h2>The Sustainability and Environmental Impact of Popular Motorsports--Guided by: Dr. James Patrick Abulencia</h2>
     <h3> Question Posed: Which popular motorsport, NASCAR or Formula 1, leaves a larger carbon footprint
on local communities?</h3>
    <strong><p>Background Info</p></strong>
    <p align="justify" style="padding:10px; overflow:scroll;">Both NASCAR and Formula 1 have made advancements towards increasing their
sustainability efforts while ensuring top performance for drivers during races. For instance,
NASCAR invested in multiple renewable energy sources to power their facilities across the
nation. They have constructed a solar farm house with, “40,000 solar panels and even provides
energy to the local grid to power 250 homes, thereby reducing total carbon dioxide emissions in
the area by 2,370 tons annually,” (ERA Environmental). Formula 1 has also made advancements and initiated its Net-Zero plan to offset its emissions and reduce its carbon footprint. “Formula 1 says the fuel will be made using
components from either carbon capture, municipal waste, or non-food biomass,” (SciBlog.org, 2022). Essentially, these “waste” products include distillate plastics, which are then synthesized to be usable as a fuel source. At the end of the 2021 season, F1 fuel was composed of 5.75% bio-
components, which was increased with the blending of 10% ethanol. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19KM-tflZP_C6aKutgm1yVt_SIpz3jTCV/view?usp=sharing">Read the full paper here</a> </p>

<div class="metformin">
     <header><h1>Project 4</h1></header>
    <h2>Effectiveness of Metformin: Room Temperature vs. Refrigerated--Guided by: Dr. James Patrick Abulencia</h2>
     <h3> Question Posed: Would the effectiveness of a metformin oral solution increase or decrease if it were to
be stored at a refrigerated temperature as opposed to room temperature?</h3>
    <strong><p>Background Info</p></strong>
    <p align="justify" style="padding:10px; overflow:scroll;">Metformin is commonly prescribed for people who have Type 2 diabetes where the body
cannot control its blood sugar levels naturally; insulin injection not necessarily needed. The drug
works by activating the body’s response to insulin, the chemical that naturally controls glucose
levels. By activating the body’s insulin response, the substance essentially decreases the amount
of glucose you absorb from food and the glucose produced in the liver. The main components in
both the metformin capsule and oral solutions are hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and nitrogen.
Diabetes is a disease that can induce life threatening health problems if one doesn’t take
the proper medication or treatment. The interaction between metformin and the body to control
glucose levels is essential to maintaining a healthy blood sugar level in instances where the body
cannot regulate itself. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/165WgXQ2z7aoAq-3BBvNwHndPTTBRdWjD/view?usp=sharing">Read the full paper here</a> </p>
